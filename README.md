# Flutter Bloc Tutorials UML Diagrams

The goal of this repo is to create UML diagrams that help beginners to understand the Flutter Bloc library tutorials.

- [Bloc Library Website](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/)

Each folder here have an README file that displays the UML diagrams for one tutorial, and have the diagrams source files.

The UML diagrams were created using the [Jebbs PlantUML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml) VS Code extension.

To save the diagrams images search for PlantUML on the VS Code Command Pallete (Ctrl+Shift+P), choose "PlantUML: Export Workspace Diagrams", and then choose "png". The files will be saved on the "out" folder.
